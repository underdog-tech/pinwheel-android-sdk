### [3.0.0](https://github.com/underdog-tech/pinwheel-android-sdk/releases/tag/3.0.0)

This new major version bump introduces an updated API to support partner-based switches.

*Deprecated events have been removed and we have updated the success event to match the current standard switch schema (used in the `direct_deposit_switch.added` webhook and the `input_allocation` event).*

#### Changed
- The `action` field in `input_allocation` event is now optional.
- The `params` field in the `success` event uses the `input_allocation` schema with fields `action` and `allocation`.

#### Removed
- Removed `input_amount` event.
